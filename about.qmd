Hi, I'm David — welcome to my project!

This site is a personal initiative to collect, create, and share helpful resources for working with R. Whether you're just starting out or you're looking for clean, ready-to-use guides, templates, and best practices, you'll find a growing collection here.

I'm passionate about making data science workflows more efficient and reproducible. With tools like Quarto, RMarkdown, and GitHub, we can build powerful and transparent data projects — and this site is my way of helping others do the same.

All content on this site is open-source, so feel free to explore, use, and adapt anything you find useful.
